### Description

#### About the app
This project is an hybrid app for of my portfolio. It contains little information about me, my skillset, 
links to my social media platform and a link to donload my Resume.

#### About the codebase
The project was built with flutter. Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. First described in 2015, Flutter was released in May 2017.

During development, Flutter apps run in a VM that offers stateful hot reload of changes without needing a full recompile. For release, Flutter apps are compiled directly to machine code, whether Intel x64 or ARM instructions, or to JavaScript if targeting the web.
