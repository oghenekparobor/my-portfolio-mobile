#### About the codebase
The project was built with flutter. Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. First described in 2015, Flutter was released in May 2017.

During development, Flutter apps run in a VM that offers stateful hot reload of changes without needing a full recompile. For release, Flutter apps are compiled directly to machine code, whether Intel x64 or ARM instructions, or to JavaScript if targeting the web.

[Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) is a wrapper around InheritedWidget to make them easier to use and more reusable. It was used because it's my favorite of all state management tool.

[Fancy Shimmer Image](https://pub.dev/packages/fancy_shimmer_image), package created for the purpose of uploading images from the internet, giving the possibility of showing a beautiful Shimmer animation while the images are not loading.
It was used to give off shimmer while image loads up to enhance/increase user experience.
